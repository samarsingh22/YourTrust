## 🎨 Features Deep Dive

### AI Installment Planning

The AI installment planner uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro to generate personalized repayment schedules:

1. **Input Analysis**: Analyzes amount, due date, and borrower context
2. **Plan Generation**: Creates 3 distinct plans with different strategies
3. **Date Validation**: Ensures all installments are before due date
4. **Smart Scheduling**: Distributes payments evenly (monthly/bi-weekly)
5. **User Selection**: Borrower selects preferred plan
6. **Proof Tracking**: Each installment tracked with screenshot uploads

**Example Plans for ₹10,000 due in 3 months:**

- **Aggressive**: 2 payments of ₹5,000 each (1 month)
- **Balanced**: 3 payments of ₹3,333 each (2 months)
- **Flexible**: 4 payments of ₹2,500 each (3 months)

### Group Lending Workflow

1. **Create Group**: User creates group and adds members
2. **Request Money**: Member posts money request to group
3. **Contributions**: Multiple members contribute partial amounts
4. **Agreement Creation**: Each contribution creates 1-on-1 agreement
5. **Request Closure**: Auto-closes when full amount received
6. **Individual Tracking**: Each agreement tracked separately

**Example:**
- Alice requests ₹10,000 from "College Friends" group
- Bob contributes ₹3,000 → Creates Agreement #1 (Bob → Alice)
- Charlie contributes ₹4,000 → Creates Agreement #2 (Charlie → Alice)
- David contributes ₹3,000 → Creates Agreement #3 (David → Alice)
- Request closes, Alice has 3 separate agreements to repay

### Trust Score Algorithm

```typescript
// Initial score: 80
let trustScore = 80

// If payment is late:
if (daysOverdue > 0) {
  if (strictMode) {
    trustScore -= (daysOverdue * 2) // Faster penalty
  } else {
    trustScore -= daysOverdue // Normal penalty
  }
}

// Minimum score: 0
trustScore = Math.max(0, trustScore)
```

### Email Templates

All emails use professional HTML templates with:
- Responsive design
- Branded colors
- Clickable buttons
- Dynamic content
- Ngrok URLs for live access

**Email Types:**
1. Agreement Request
2. Witness Approval Request
3. Witness Approved Notification
4. Payment Reminder
5. Settlement Confirmation
